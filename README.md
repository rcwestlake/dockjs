#DockJS

```
"Any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript"
— Atwood’s Law
```

Ryan & Kinan here (creators of DockJS) - We are both motivated to learn more and more Javascript each day, to refine our craft, and garner a deeper understanding of JavaScript's core fundamentals. [ScratchJS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scratch-js/alploljligeomonipppgaahpkenfnfkn?hl=en-US) has always been a great go-to since its release, but we wanted to access a REPL offline from our desktop, and add a few features that take practicing, writing, and learning JavaScript to another level.

In this project, we designed an interpretation of a traditional desktop application using Electron, specifically a JavaScript REPL interface that fully functions offline and can be accessed in the dock in multiple platforms. Since the recent additions to the JavaScript library in ES6/ES7, we wanted to have a feature that allowed a user to upload code in vanilla JS that could be transpiled into ES6 and vice versa.

Since this project was terra incognita, a big part of the learning was to document our travels. To do that we each addressed different sides of the project:

Learning Electron from a higher mental model/view, what it is, and how we got started.

* [Kinan's Post--A High Level View of Electron](https://medium.com/@iamkinansw/an-intro-to-electron-97fad3973951#.t4k77u4ew)
* [Ryan's Post--Hello, Electron](https://medium.com/@rcwestlake/hello-electron-394451da0844#.q7t5o91rn)

Particular technical problems that we encountered and how we solved it. Also, what we would improve if we started again.

###Getting Started

DockJS is in its final stages of post-production and is on its way to the App Store & Google Play. We also plan to host a website that will allow this fine tool to be downloaded easily as an open source project. We will look forward to any contributions/PRs that new users want to submit and welcome feedback.

1. git clone project
2. npm i
3. 

Note: DockJS will show up as a small toolbar icon in the form of a coffee mug symbolizing your daily ritual for learning JavaScript. Instructions are provided in "I" (information). You are able to transpile ES6 code into Vanailla JS and vice versa. Happy coding!
